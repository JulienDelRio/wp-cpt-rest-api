---

## PART 3: Discrepancies Found

### Critical Issues

#### CRIT-001: Missing DELETE Endpoint for CPT Posts
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, Section "CRUD Operations", Requirement #3
**Current State**: The specification explicitly requires DELETE operations for CPT posts:
> "DELETE: Delete individual posts by ID"

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` (lines 256-313)
- Only GET, POST, PUT/PATCH endpoints are registered
- No DELETE endpoint registration found in `register_all_cpt_endpoints()`

**Impact**: Missing core CRUD functionality. Users cannot delete CPT posts via the API, which is a standard REST operation.

#### CRIT-002: Missing DELETE Endpoint Documentation
**Specification Reference**: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md
**Current State**: API documentation does not include DELETE endpoint examples or error responses for deletion operations.

**Code Evidence**: API_ENDPOINTS.md only documents GET, POST, PUT/PATCH operations (lines 1-782)

**Impact**: Incomplete API documentation. Even if DELETE is added, developers won't know how to use it.

### High Priority Issues

#### HIGH-001: Inconsistent Option Name in Specifications
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md vs actual implementation
**Current State**:
- SPECS.md documents option as: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (line 334)
- Implementation uses: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (correct)
- CLAUDE.md documents: `cpt_rest_api_include_non_public` (line 49)

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/admin/class-wp-cpt-restapi-admin.php` (line 56)
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (activation hook does NOT initialize this option)

**Impact**: CLAUDE.md has incorrect option name. More critically, the activation hook doesn't initialize this option, which could cause issues on fresh installs.

#### HIGH-002: Missing Activation Hook Initialization
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, Section "Deployment Requirements"
**Current State**: The activation hook in `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` initializes:
- `cpt_rest_api_keys`
- `cpt_rest_api_active_cpts`
- `cpt_rest_api_toolset_relationships`

But does NOT initialize:
- `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` (should default to "cpt")
- `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (should default to empty array)

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (lines 31-48)

**Impact**: On plugin activation, these options won't exist until first save, potentially causing undefined behavior.

### Medium Priority Issues

#### MED-001: OpenAPI Specification Missing DELETE Operations
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, API Specification section
**Current State**: If DELETE endpoint is added, the OpenAPI generator must also document it.

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php`
- Need to verify paths generation includes DELETE method

**Impact**: OpenAPI spec will be incomplete even after DELETE is implemented.

#### MED-002: WordPress Best Practices Requirement Not Verified
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md (line 38)
**Current State**: Specification states:
> "Keep behavior and best practices of default WordPress API"

However, there's no verification that the implementation follows WordPress REST API conventions for:
- Error codes and messages
- Response formats
- Capability checks
- Nonce verification for admin operations

**Code Evidence**: Need to audit against WordPress REST API Controller standards

**Impact**: Plugin may deviate from WordPress conventions, causing integration issues.

#### MED-003: Missing File Structure Documentation Accuracy
**Specification Reference**: CLAUDE.md (lines 96-111)
**Current State**: CLAUDE.md states API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md are at project root, but they're actually in `src/` directory.

**Code Evidence**:
- Documented location: `wp-cpt-rest-api/API_ENDPOINTS.md`
- Actual location: `wp-cpt-rest-api/src/API_ENDPOINTS.md`

**Impact**: Developer confusion when looking for documentation files.

### Low Priority Issues

#### LOW-001: Version Number Discrepancy in API Response
**Specification Reference**: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md (line 34)
**Current State**: API_ENDPOINTS.md shows version as "0.1" in example response, but plugin is at version 0.2.

**Code Evidence**:
```json
"version": "0.1"  // Should be "0.2"
```

**Impact**: Outdated documentation examples.

#### LOW-002: Missing Assets Directory
**Specification Reference**: CLAUDE.md (lines 105-106)
**Current State**: File structure documentation mentions:
```
├── assets/ (frontend assets)
│   ├── css/ (admin styling)
│   └── js/ (admin JavaScript)
```

**Code Evidence**: Need to verify these directories exist

**Impact**: File structure documentation may be inaccurate.

### Discrepancy Categories

- **Missing Features**: 2 (DELETE endpoint, initialization in activation hook)
- **Incorrect Implementations**: 0
- **Outdated Code**: 0
- **Security Issues**: 0
- **Performance Issues**: 0
- **Documentation Gaps**: 6

## PART 4: Prioritized Task List

### Critical Tasks

#### TASK-001: Implement DELETE Endpoint for CPT Posts
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: Core CRUD functionality is incomplete. REST API standard requires DELETE operations. This affects all CPT types and prevents complete resource lifecycle management.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: Core Requirements > CRUD Operations (line 36)
- Requirement: "DELETE: Delete individual posts by ID"

**Current State**:
No DELETE endpoint is registered in the REST API. The file `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` only registers GET, POST, PUT/PATCH endpoints for CPT posts.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` (Lines: 256-313)
- Action: Add DELETE method to the existing `/{cpt}/{id}` endpoint registration
- Add callback method `delete_cpt_post()` to handle deletion
- Implement proper permission checks and WordPress post deletion
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found, 403 for forbidden)

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Add DELETE endpoint to the WordPress Custom Post Types REST API plugin. The endpoint should:

1. Register a DELETE method for the /{cpt}/{id} route in the register_all_cpt_endpoints() method in src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php around line 260
2. Create a new callback method delete_cpt_post() that:
   - Validates the CPT is active
   - Checks if the post exists and is the correct type
   - Verifies user has permission to delete
   - Calls wp_delete_post() to permanently delete the post
   - Returns success response with deleted post data
   - Returns appropriate error codes: 404 if post not found, 403 if CPT not enabled or permission denied
3. Follow the same pattern as update_cpt_post() and get_cpt_post() methods
4. Include proper error handling and sanitization
5. Return HTTP 200 status on successful deletion with the deleted post object
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE endpoint registered for `/{base}/v1/{cpt}/{id}` pattern
- [ ] `delete_cpt_post()` callback method implemented
- [ ] Returns 200 OK with deleted post data on success
- [ ] Returns 404 Not Found for invalid post ID
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden if CPT not enabled
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden if user lacks delete permission
- [ ] Post is permanently deleted from WordPress database
- [ ] Works for all enabled CPT types

---

#### TASK-002: Add DELETE Operation to API Documentation
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Documentation Gap
**Impact**: Even after implementing DELETE, developers won't know it exists or how to use it. Affects all API consumers.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md
- Section: Available Endpoints
- Requirement: Document all CRUD operations including DELETE

**Current State**:
API_ENDPOINTS.md documents endpoints 1-9 but missing DELETE for CPT posts. Only includes GET, POST, PUT/PATCH operations.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/API_ENDPOINTS.md` (after line 272)
- Add new section "6. Delete CPT Post" with:
  - Endpoint URL: `DELETE /wp-json/cpt/v1/{post_type}/{id}`
  - Request headers (Authorization)
  - Success response (200 OK)
  - Error responses (404, 403)
  - cURL example
  - JavaScript fetch example

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Add DELETE endpoint documentation to src/API_ENDPOINTS.md after the "Get Single CPT Post" section (around line 272). The documentation should include:

- Endpoint: DELETE /wp-json/cpt/v1/{post_type}/{id}
- Description: Permanently deletes a specific post from the Custom Post Type
- Success Response (200 OK) with deleted post data
- Error responses (404, 403)
- cURL example
- JavaScript fetch example

Follow the existing documentation style and formatting.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE endpoint documented in API_ENDPOINTS.md
- [ ] Includes request format with required headers
- [ ] Documents 200 OK success response
- [ ] Documents 404 Not Found error
- [ ] Documents 403 Forbidden error
- [ ] Includes cURL usage example
- [ ] Includes JavaScript fetch example
- [ ] Follows existing documentation formatting

---

### High Priority Tasks

#### TASK-003: Fix Activation Hook to Initialize All Options
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: On fresh plugin installation, missing options could cause undefined behavior. Affects new installations until admin saves settings.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: Configuration System > WordPress Options (line 327-334)
- Requirement: All plugin options should be initialized on activation

**Current State**:
Activation function in `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` only initializes 3 of 5 required options:
- Missing: `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` (should default to "cpt")
- Missing: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (should default to empty array)

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (Lines: 31-48)
- Add initialization for missing options with proper defaults

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the activate_wp_cpt_restapi() function in src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php (around line 31) to initialize ALL plugin options on activation. Add missing initializations for:

1. cpt_rest_api_base_segment (default: 'cpt')
2. cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts (default: empty array)

Add these after the existing option initializations around line 47, using add_option() to avoid overwriting existing values.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` initialized to "cpt" on activation
- [ ] `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` initialized to empty array
- [ ] All 5 plugin options exist after fresh activation
- [ ] Options are only created if they don't already exist (using `add_option`)
- [ ] No warnings or errors on plugin activation

---

#### TASK-004: Update CLAUDE.md with Correct Option Name
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Documentation Gap
**Impact**: Developers following CLAUDE.md will use incorrect option name in code, causing bugs.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: CLAUDE.md
- Section: Plugin Options (line 49)
- Requirement: Accurate documentation of all option names

**Current State**:
CLAUDE.md line 49 states: `cpt_rest_api_include_non_public`
Correct name is: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts`

**Required Changes**:
- File: `C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\CLAUDE.md` (Line: 49)
- Change option name to match implementation

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Fix the incorrect option name in CLAUDE.md at line 49. Change:

FROM: cpt_rest_api_include_non_public (Boolean)
TO: cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts (Array)

Update the description to reflect that it's an array containing visibility types: 'publicly_queryable', 'show_ui', 'private'.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] Option name corrected to `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts`
- [ ] Description updated to indicate it's an array
- [ ] Description mentions valid values (publicly_queryable, show_ui, private)
- [ ] Matches implementation in class-wp-cpt-restapi-admin.php

---

#### TASK-005: Add DELETE to OpenAPI Specification
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: OpenAPI spec will be incomplete after DELETE endpoint is implemented. Tools relying on spec won't show DELETE operation.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: OpenAPI Documentation (line 53-56)
- Requirement: Complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification with all endpoints

**Current State**:
OpenAPI generator needs to include DELETE method in path generation for CPT endpoints after DELETE implementation.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php`
- Update path generation to include DELETE operation with proper schema

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
After implementing the DELETE endpoint for CPT posts, update the OpenAPI specification generator in src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php to include DELETE operations.

Add a DELETE operation for the /{cpt}/{id} path with:
- operationId: deleteCptPost
- summary: Delete a specific CPT post
- parameters: cpt and id path parameters
- responses: 200 (success), 404 (not found), 403 (forbidden)
- security: bearerAuth required
- tags: [Custom Post Types]

Follow the same pattern used for GET, POST, PUT operations.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE operation included in OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Proper response schemas defined (200, 404, 403)
- [ ] Security requirement (bearerAuth) specified
- [ ] Operation appears in generated /openapi endpoint
- [ ] Compatible with Swagger UI and other OpenAPI tools

---

### Medium Priority Tasks

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: CLAUDE.md
- Section: File Structure (lines 96-111)
- Requirement: Accurate file structure documentation

**Current State**:
CLAUDE.md shows API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md at project root, but they're actually in `src/` directory.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\CLAUDE.md` (Lines: 96-111)
- Move documentation files inside src/ folder in the structure diagram

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the file structure in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-111) to reflect the actual location of documentation files. Move API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md inside the src/ directory in the file structure diagram.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] File structure diagram updated
- [ ] API_ENDPOINTS.md shown in src/ directory
- [ ] OPENAPI.md shown in src/ directory
- [ ] docs/SPECS.md included in structure
- [ ] Matches actual file locations in repository

---

#### TASK-007: Update Version Number in API Documentation Examples
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Outdated Documentation
**Impact**: Confusing version information in documentation examples.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md
- Section: Namespace Info (line 34)
- Requirement: Current version number in examples

**Current State**:
Example response shows version "0.1" but plugin is at version 0.2.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/API_ENDPOINTS.md` (Line: 34)
- Update version in example response

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the version number in src/API_ENDPOINTS.md at line 34. Change version from "0.1" to "0.2" in the example response. Verify there are no other instances of version "0.1" in the documentation that should be updated to "0.2".
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] Version updated to "0.2" in namespace info example
- [ ] All version references in API_ENDPOINTS.md are current
- [ ] Matches WP_CPT_RESTAPI_VERSION constant in code

---

#### TASK-008: Verify WordPress REST API Best Practices Compliance
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Compliance Verification
**Impact**: Potential deviation from WordPress standards could cause integration issues.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: CRUD Operations (line 38)
- Requirement: "Keep behavior and best practices of default WordPress API"

**Current State**:
Need to audit implementation against WordPress REST API Controller standards for:
- Error code conventions
- Response format consistency
- Capability checks
- Permission callbacks
- Sanitization and validation patterns

**Required Changes**:
- Files: All REST API implementation files
- Verify compliance with WordPress REST API handbook standards

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:

### Positive Findings

The codebase demonstrates several strengths:
- Well-structured architecture following WordPress plugin best practices
- Clean separation of concerns (Admin, REST, Auth, OpenAPI)
- Comprehensive admin interface with good UX
- Strong security implementation (API key authentication, sanitization, validation)
- Extensive inline documentation and code comments
- Good error handling patterns
- Support for advanced features (Toolset integration, granular CPT visibility control)
- Dynamic OpenAPI specification generation

The missing DELETE endpoint and documentation issues are straightforward to fix and don't indicate systemic problems with the codebase architecture.
