## PART 3: Discrepancies Found

### Critical Issues

#### CRIT-001: Missing DELETE Endpoint for CPT Posts
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, Section "CRUD Operations", Requirement #3
**Current State**: The specification explicitly requires DELETE operations for CPT posts:
> "DELETE: Delete individual posts by ID"

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` (lines 256-313)
- Only GET, POST, PUT/PATCH endpoints are registered
- No DELETE endpoint registration found in `register_all_cpt_endpoints()`

**Impact**: Missing core CRUD functionality. Users cannot delete CPT posts via the API, which is a standard REST operation.

#### CRIT-002: Missing DELETE Endpoint Documentation
**Specification Reference**: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md
**Current State**: API documentation does not include DELETE endpoint examples or error responses for deletion operations.

**Code Evidence**: API_ENDPOINTS.md only documents GET, POST, PUT/PATCH operations (lines 1-782)

**Impact**: Incomplete API documentation. Even if DELETE is added, developers won't know how to use it.

### High Priority Issues

#### HIGH-001: Inconsistent Option Name in Specifications
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md vs actual implementation
**Current State**:
- SPECS.md documents option as: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (line 334)
- Implementation uses: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (correct)
- CLAUDE.md documents: `cpt_rest_api_include_non_public` (line 49)

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/admin/class-wp-cpt-restapi-admin.php` (line 56)
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (activation hook does NOT initialize this option)

**Impact**: CLAUDE.md has incorrect option name. More critically, the activation hook doesn't initialize this option, which could cause issues on fresh installs.

#### HIGH-002: Missing Activation Hook Initialization
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, Section "Deployment Requirements"
**Current State**: The activation hook in `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` initializes:
- `cpt_rest_api_keys`
- `cpt_rest_api_active_cpts`
- `cpt_rest_api_toolset_relationships`

But does NOT initialize:
- `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` (should default to "cpt")
- `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (should default to empty array)

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (lines 31-48)

**Impact**: On plugin activation, these options won't exist until first save, potentially causing undefined behavior.

### Medium Priority Issues

#### MED-001: OpenAPI Specification Missing DELETE Operations
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md, API Specification section
**Current State**: If DELETE endpoint is added, the OpenAPI generator must also document it.

**Code Evidence**:
- File: `src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php`
- Need to verify paths generation includes DELETE method

**Impact**: OpenAPI spec will be incomplete even after DELETE is implemented.

#### MED-002: WordPress Best Practices Requirement Not Verified
**Specification Reference**: docs/SPECS.md (line 38)
**Current State**: Specification states:
> "Keep behavior and best practices of default WordPress API"

However, there's no verification that the implementation follows WordPress REST API conventions for:
- Error codes and messages
- Response formats
- Capability checks
- Nonce verification for admin operations

**Code Evidence**: Need to audit against WordPress REST API Controller standards

**Impact**: Plugin may deviate from WordPress conventions, causing integration issues.

#### MED-003: Missing File Structure Documentation Accuracy
**Specification Reference**: CLAUDE.md (lines 96-111)
**Current State**: CLAUDE.md states API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md are at project root, but they're actually in `src/` directory.

**Code Evidence**:
- Documented location: `wp-cpt-rest-api/API_ENDPOINTS.md`
- Actual location: `wp-cpt-rest-api/src/API_ENDPOINTS.md`

**Impact**: Developer confusion when looking for documentation files.

### Low Priority Issues

#### LOW-001: Version Number Discrepancy in API Response
**Specification Reference**: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md (line 34)
**Current State**: API_ENDPOINTS.md shows version as "0.1" in example response, but plugin is at version 0.2.

**Code Evidence**:
```json
"version": "0.1"  // Should be "0.2"
```

**Impact**: Outdated documentation examples.

#### LOW-002: Missing Assets Directory
**Specification Reference**: CLAUDE.md (lines 105-106)
**Current State**: File structure documentation mentions:
```
├── assets/ (frontend assets)
│   ├── css/ (admin styling)
│   └── js/ (admin JavaScript)
```

**Code Evidence**: Need to verify these directories exist

**Impact**: File structure documentation may be inaccurate.

### Discrepancy Categories

- **Missing Features**: 2 (DELETE endpoint, initialization in activation hook)
- **Incorrect Implementations**: 0
- **Outdated Code**: 0
- **Security Issues**: 0
- **Performance Issues**: 0
- **Documentation Gaps**: 6

## PART 4: Prioritized Task List

### Critical Tasks

#### TASK-001: Implement DELETE Endpoint for CPT Posts
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: Core CRUD functionality is incomplete. REST API standard requires DELETE operations. This affects all CPT types and prevents complete resource lifecycle management.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: Core Requirements > CRUD Operations (line 36)
- Requirement: "DELETE: Delete individual posts by ID"

**Current State**:
No DELETE endpoint is registered in the REST API. The file `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` only registers GET, POST, PUT/PATCH endpoints for CPT posts.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php` (Lines: 256-313)
- Action: Add DELETE method to the existing `/{cpt}/{id}` endpoint registration
- Add callback method `delete_cpt_post()` to handle deletion
- Implement proper permission checks and WordPress post deletion
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found, 403 for forbidden)

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Add DELETE endpoint to the WordPress Custom Post Types REST API plugin. The endpoint should:

1. Register a DELETE method for the /{cpt}/{id} route in the register_all_cpt_endpoints() method in src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php around line 260
2. Create a new callback method delete_cpt_post() that:
   - Validates the CPT is active
   - Checks if the post exists and is the correct type
   - Verifies user has permission to delete
   - Calls wp_delete_post() to permanently delete the post
   - Returns success response with deleted post data
   - Returns appropriate error codes: 404 if post not found, 403 if CPT not enabled or permission denied
3. Follow the same pattern as update_cpt_post() and get_cpt_post() methods
4. Include proper error handling and sanitization
5. Return HTTP 200 status on successful deletion with the deleted post object
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE endpoint registered for `/{base}/v1/{cpt}/{id}` pattern
- [ ] `delete_cpt_post()` callback method implemented
- [ ] Returns 200 OK with deleted post data on success
- [ ] Returns 404 Not Found for invalid post ID
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden if CPT not enabled
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden if user lacks delete permission
- [ ] Post is permanently deleted from WordPress database
- [ ] Works for all enabled CPT types

---

#### TASK-002: Add DELETE Operation to API Documentation
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Documentation Gap
**Impact**: Even after implementing DELETE, developers won't know it exists or how to use it. Affects all API consumers.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: src/API_ENDPOINTS.md
- Section: Available Endpoints
- Requirement: Document all CRUD operations including DELETE

**Current State**:
API_ENDPOINTS.md documents endpoints 1-9 but missing DELETE for CPT posts. Only includes GET, POST, PUT/PATCH operations.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/API_ENDPOINTS.md` (after line 272)
- Add new section "6. Delete CPT Post" with:
  - Endpoint URL: `DELETE /wp-json/cpt/v1/{post_type}/{id}`
  - Request headers (Authorization)
  - Success response (200 OK)
  - Error responses (404, 403)
  - cURL example
  - JavaScript fetch example

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Add DELETE endpoint documentation to src/API_ENDPOINTS.md after the "Get Single CPT Post" section (around line 272). The documentation should follow this exact format:

### 6. Delete CPT Post
**DELETE** `/wp-json/cpt/v1/{post_type}/{id}`

Permanently deletes a specific post from the Custom Post Type.

**Example:**
```
DELETE /wp-json/cpt/v1/product/123
```

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "deleted": true,
  "previous": {
    "id": 123,
    "title": "Sample Product",
    "content": "Product description...",
    "excerpt": "Short description...",
    "slug": "sample-product",
    "status": "publish",
    "type": "product",
    "date": "2024-01-15 10:30:00",
    "modified": "2024-01-16 14:20:00",
    "author": "1",
    "featured_media": 456,
    "meta": {
      "custom_field_1": "value1",
      "custom_field_2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
```

Include error responses section and usage examples for both cURL and JavaScript (fetch), following the existing documentation style.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE endpoint documented in API_ENDPOINTS.md
- [ ] Includes request format with required headers
- [ ] Documents 200 OK success response
- [ ] Documents 404 Not Found error
- [ ] Documents 403 Forbidden error
- [ ] Includes cURL usage example
- [ ] Includes JavaScript fetch example
- [ ] Follows existing documentation formatting

### High Priority Tasks

#### TASK-003: Fix Activation Hook to Initialize All Options
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: On fresh plugin installation, missing options could cause undefined behavior. Affects new installations until admin saves settings.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: Configuration System > WordPress Options (line 327-334)
- Requirement: All plugin options should be initialized on activation

**Current State**:
Activation function in `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` only initializes 3 of 5 required options:
- Missing: `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` (should default to "cpt")
- Missing: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` (should default to empty array)

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php` (Lines: 31-48)
- Add initialization for missing options with proper defaults

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the activate_wp_cpt_restapi() function in src/wp-cpt-rest-api.php (around line 31) to initialize ALL plugin options on activation. Add the following missing initializations:

1. After line 47, add:
```php
// Initialize base segment option
if ( ! get_option( 'cpt_rest_api_base_segment' ) ) {
    add_option( 'cpt_rest_api_base_segment', 'cpt' );
}

// Initialize include non-public CPTs option
if ( ! get_option( 'cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts' ) ) {
    add_option( 'cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts', array() );
}
```

Ensure all 5 plugin options are initialized with proper default values matching the specification.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] `cpt_rest_api_base_segment` initialized to "cpt" on activation
- [ ] `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts` initialized to empty array
- [ ] All 5 plugin options exist after fresh activation
- [ ] Options are only created if they don't already exist (using `add_option`)
- [ ] No warnings or errors on plugin activation

---

#### TASK-004: Update CLAUDE.md with Correct Option Name
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Documentation Gap
**Impact**: Developers following CLAUDE.md will use incorrect option name in code, causing bugs.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: CLAUDE.md
- Section: Plugin Options (line 49)
- Requirement: Accurate documentation of all option names

**Current State**:
CLAUDE.md line 49 states: `cpt_rest_api_include_non_public`
Correct name is: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts`

**Required Changes**:
- File: `C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\CLAUDE.md` (Line: 49)
- Change option name to match implementation

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Fix the incorrect option name in CLAUDE.md at line 49. Change:

FROM: `cpt_rest_api_include_non_public`: Boolean for including non-public CPTs

TO: `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts`: Array of non-public CPT visibility types to include

Also update the description to reflect that it's an array, not a boolean. The array can contain: 'publicly_queryable', 'show_ui', 'private'.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] Option name corrected to `cpt_rest_api_include_nonpublic_cpts`
- [ ] Description updated to indicate it's an array
- [ ] Description mentions valid values (publicly_queryable, show_ui, private)
- [ ] Matches implementation in class-wp-cpt-restapi-admin.php

---

#### TASK-005: Add DELETE to OpenAPI Specification
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Missing Feature
**Impact**: OpenAPI spec will be incomplete after DELETE endpoint is implemented. Tools relying on spec won't show DELETE operation.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: OpenAPI Documentation (line 53-56)
- Requirement: Complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification with all endpoints

**Current State**:
OpenAPI generator needs to include DELETE method in path generation for CPT endpoints after DELETE implementation.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php`
- Update path generation to include DELETE operation with proper schema

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
After implementing the DELETE endpoint for CPT posts, update the OpenAPI specification generator in src/swagger/class-wp-cpt-restapi-openapi.php to include DELETE operations.

In the generate_paths() method where CPT endpoints are defined, add a DELETE operation for the `/{cpt}/{id}` path with:
- operationId: deleteCptPost
- summary: Delete a specific CPT post
- parameters: cpt and id path parameters
- responses: 200 (success with deleted post), 404 (not found), 403 (forbidden)
- security: bearerAuth required
- requestBody: none
- tags: [Custom Post Types]

Follow the same pattern used for GET, POST, PUT operations in the existing OpenAPI generator.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] DELETE operation included in OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Proper response schemas defined (200, 404, 403)
- [ ] Security requirement (bearerAuth) specified
- [ ] Operation appears in generated /openapi endpoint
- [ ] Compatible with Swagger UI and other OpenAPI tools

---

### Medium Priority Tasks

**Category**: Documentation Gap
**Impact**: Developers will look for documentation files in wrong location.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: CLAUDE.md
- Section: File Structure (lines 96-111)
- Requirement: Accurate file structure documentation

**Current State**:
CLAUDE.md shows API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md at project root, but they're actually in `src/` directory.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\CLAUDE.md` (Lines: 96-111)
- Move documentation files inside src/ folder in the structure diagram

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the file structure in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-111) to reflect the actual location of documentation files. Move API_ENDPOINTS.md and OPENAPI.md inside the src/ directory:

```
wp-cpt-rest-api/

- Section: Namespace Info (line 34)
- Requirement: Current version number in examples

**Current State**:
Example response shows version "0.1" but plugin is at version 0.2.

**Required Changes**:
- File: `src/API_ENDPOINTS.md` (Line: 34)
- Update version in example response

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Update the version number in src/API_ENDPOINTS.md at line 34. Change the example response from:

```json
{
  "namespace": "cpt/v1",
  "description": "WordPress Custom Post Types REST API",
  "version": "0.1"
}
```

TO:

```json
{
  "namespace": "cpt/v1",
  "description": "WordPress Custom Post Types REST API",
  "version": "0.2"
}
```

Verify there are no other instances of version "0.1" in the documentation that should be updated to "0.2".
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] Version updated to "0.2" in namespace info example
- [ ] All version references in API_ENDPOINTS.md are current
- [ ] Matches WP_CPT_RESTAPI_VERSION constant in code

---

#### TASK-008: Verify WordPress REST API Best Practices Compliance
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Compliance Verification
**Impact**: Potential deviation from WordPress standards could cause integration issues.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: docs/SPECS.md
- Section: CRUD Operations (line 38)
- Requirement: "Keep behavior and best practices of default WordPress API"

**Current State**:
Need to audit implementation against WordPress REST API Controller standards for:
- Error code conventions
- Response format consistency
- Capability checks
- Permission callbacks
- Sanitization and validation patterns

**Required Changes**:
- Files: All REST API implementation files
- Verify compliance with WordPress REST API handbook standards

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Perform a comprehensive audit of the REST API implementation in src/rest-api/class-wp-cpt-restapi-rest.php to ensure compliance with WordPress REST API best practices:

1. Verify error codes match WordPress conventions:
   - rest_forbidden
   - rest_not_logged_in
   - rest_post_invalid_id
   - rest_cannot_create
   - rest_cannot_update
   - rest_cannot_delete (for new DELETE endpoint)

2. Check response formats follow WP_REST_Response patterns

3. Ensure permission callbacks are used correctly (currently using __return_true everywhere - verify this is intentional)

4. Verify sanitization callbacks use WordPress functions (sanitize_text_field, wp_kses_post, etc.)

5. Check that capability checks align with WordPress post capabilities (edit_post, delete_post, etc.)

6. Compare implementation with WP_REST_Posts_Controller for consistency

Document any deviations from WordPress standards and recommend corrections if needed.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] Error codes match WordPress REST API conventions
- [ ] Response formats consistent with WP_REST_Response
- [ ] Permission callbacks properly implemented
- [ ] Sanitization follows WordPress standards
- [ ] Capability checks align with WordPress post capabilities
- [ ] No major deviations from WP_REST_Posts_Controller patterns

**Category**: File Structure Verification
**Impact**: Minor - file structure documentation accuracy only.

**Specification Reference**:
- Document: CLAUDE.md
- Section: File Structure (lines 105-106)
- Requirement: Accurate documentation of all directories

**Current State**:
CLAUDE.md mentions assets/css/ and assets/js/ directories. Need to verify they exist and contain expected files.

**Required Changes**:
- Verification task only - check if directories exist
- Update CLAUDE.md if structure is different

**Ready-to-Use Prompt**:
```
Verify the assets directory structure in the WordPress Custom Post Types REST API plugin:

1. Check if C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\src\assets\css\ exists and contains admin CSS files
2. Check if C:\dev\perso\wp-cpt-rest-api\src\assets\js\ exists and contains admin JavaScript files
3. Verify the files referenced in class-wp-cpt-restapi-admin.php:
   - assets/css/wp-cpt-restapi-admin.css (line 107)
   - assets/js/wp-cpt-restapi-admin.js (line 128)

If directories or files are missing or structure is different, update the file structure diagram in CLAUDE.md to reflect the actual structure.
```

**Verification Criteria**:
- [ ] assets/css/ directory exists with admin CSS file
- [ ] assets/js/ directory exists with admin JavaScript file
- [ ] Files match those referenced in enqueue calls
- [ ] CLAUDE.md file structure is accurate
